# Welcome to the ChirpOn project

This is the home repo for ChirpOn - an anonymous microblogging site wherein people can share their thoughts with community guided moderation similar to Reddit. Anyone is free to join and contribute. The initial MVP will provide users the option to create accounts and post "tweets" in a general channel. In subsequent versions, new features such as image support as well as community creation and NSFW flairs will be added.

The project uses the "PERN" (Postgres, Express, React and NodeJS) stack alongwith GraphQL(using Apollo). The server and web frameworks have separate readme's with their respective implementational details.
